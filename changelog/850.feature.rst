PEP-518 support: provide a tox configuration flag ``build`` which can be either ``sdist`` or ``wheel``. For ``sdist`` (default) we build the package as before by using ``python setup.py sdist``. However, when ``wheel`` is enabled now we'll use ``pip wheel`` to build it, and we'll also install wheels in these case into the environments. Note: ``pip`` 10 supports specifying project dependencies (such as ``setuptools-scm``, or a given ``setuptools`` version) via ``pyproject.toml``. Once ``pip`` supports building ``sdist`` to we'll migrate over the ``sdist`` build too. @gaborbernat
